### 1. Introduction
For this project, I decided to work with StackOverflow survey data 2017;  data can be downloaded through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017). For the purpose of this project, I proposed three research questions for analysis:
1. What is the most popular education type for developers after formal schooling and education?
2. Which country has the highest career satisfaction?
3. What relates to Methodology?

For the analysis technical work, I used Python 3 Jupyter notebook which is present here under the name `Project 1 - Data Science Blog Post.ipynb`.
